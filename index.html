		<p>As a programmer, every now and then you get approached by someone who has this "great idea for an app" that‚Äôs gonna be "yuge". The best idea. Nobody else has better ideas.</p>
		<p>Most of these ideas are terrible. The defence I've learned against this is to be sceptical / critical.</p>
		<p>This is about one of those ideas, and how I was wrong about it, and what I learned from working on it.</p>

			<p>This is what Sasjkia really looks like.</p>
			<p>Sasjkia has a background in political organising with the Labour party</p>
			<p>At the time everyone was worried about the 2016 US election. I figured that everything would be fine. Trump didn't have a hope of winning.</p>

		<p>I was sceptical about the idea. I thought that if local organisers weren't already doing this then there wasn't a demand.</p>
		<p>I also thought that Donald Trump didn‚Äôt have a hope of getting elected, and Hillary Clinton had it in the bag. Waste of time.</p>
		<p>I was wrong on both counts.</p>

	<h2>Just because it hasn't already been done, doesn't mean it's not a good idea.</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		This may seem obvious to other people.<br>
		I tend to assume that if something hasn't been done already, it's probably because it's not a good idea. This is true for most things, like, idk, unicorn pants. But not everything.

<section data-background="img/busy.jpg" data-background-size="contain">
	<aside class="notes">
		I was busy so I left them to it but told Sasjkia I'd help out at some point.<br>
		Had a free Friday night, figured I'd help out with a tiny issue or two. Found two major branches, each wildly different. Unfinished redesign branch, and people were still committing on master. Before I could tackle any tasks, someone needed to finish the redesign that Jo had started, and fix merge conflicts. So that was my weekend gone.<br>
		I've been working on it ever since, because someone needed to, and now I'm de facto front-end lead I guess?

	<h3>Open-source volunteers <br/> !== <br/> coworkers</h3>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>People drop in and out. Less reliable. Harder to fill certain roles.</p>
		<p>Open source means you don't get to pick your colleagues, you take what you can get. Many contributions are great, some not so much. Some are like a cat just gave you a gift of a dead bird. (e.g. the PHP captcha)</p>

		That being said, we've had some really valuable contributions from junior devs, I LOVE getting junior dev contributions and we really want more. The problem isn't bad code, it's people who don't read the instructions properly. I hate having to turn away someone's hard work.
