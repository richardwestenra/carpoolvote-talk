		<p>As a programmer, every now and then you get approached by someone who has this ‚Äúgreat idea for an app‚Äù that‚Äôs gonna be ‚Äòyuge‚Äô. And most of these ideas are terrible. And my defence to this is to be super sceptical.</p>

		<p>I was sceptical about the idea. I thought it would never work, and that if local organisers weren't already doing this then there wasn't a need.</p>
		<p>I also thought that Donald Trump didn‚Äôt have a hope of getting elected, and Hillary Clinton had it in the bag.</p>
		<p>I was wrong on both counts.</p>

	<h3>Open-source volunteers <br/> !== <br/> coworkers</h3>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>People drop in and out. Less reliable. Harder to fill certain roles.</p>
		<p>Open source means you don't get to pick your colleagues, you take what you can get. Many contributions are great, some not so much. Some are like a cat just gave you a gift of a dead bird. (e.g. the PHP captcha)</p>

		That being said, we've had some really valuable contributions from junior devs, I LOVE getting junior dev contributions and we really want more. The problem isn't bad code, it's people who don't read the instructions properly. I hate having to turn away someone's hard work.

		<li>üëç &nbsp; Encourages newbie dev contributions</li>
		<li>üëç &nbsp; Makes senior devs less crucial</li>
		<li>üëç &nbsp; Speeds up onboarding</li>
	</ul>
	<aside class="notes">
		<p>Keeping it low-tech helps encourage newbie devs, but it‚Äôs a fine balance.</p>
		<p>Also helps make myself redundant, so that it‚Äôs easy for me to drop out and have someone else take over.</p>

		<h2>We're hiring!</h2>

			Finally: QuantumBlack. ‚ÄúI know the company name sounds kind of sinister, but we‚Äôre actually a completely legitimate organisation. Here‚Äôs some pictures of our various worldwide offices, and some of my coworkers, and my boss. All totally normal and above board, nothing to see here. Anyway we‚Äôre hiring minions and henchmen to man our new subterranean lair under Trafalgar Square. If you‚Äôre interested please come talk to me, either in the pub afterwards, or get in touch at any of my variety of imaginative online handles.‚Äù
